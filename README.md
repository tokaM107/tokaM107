### 👋 Hey there, I’m Toka!
Just a girl passionate about data 📈
### 

A coffee-fueled explorer of patterns, outliers, and all things data ☕📊  
Currently juggling:
- 📚 My life as a Computer & Data Science student
- 🧠 Deep dives into machine learning 
- 💡 Turning raw data into dashboards that *actually* make sense
- 🎮 Hacking together smart systems

#### 🛠️ What’s in my toolkit?
| 🔍 Data Wrangling | 🧠 Machine Learning | 📊 Visualization |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Python (my BFF), Pandas, NumPy, Polars | Scikit-learn, Transformers, LLMs | Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib |
| SQL  | Decision Trees to LLaMA | Dashboards that tell stories |

#### 🧩 Fun fact:
I take forever to study lectures—**not** because I'm slow, but because I like to dig deep and *really* understand what’s going on. Perfectionist? Maybe. Passionate? Definitely.
